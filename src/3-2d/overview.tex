\section{Overview}
Quantum technologies offer exotic and impressive capabilities in computation, sensing, and information \cite{malik2019science}. While several systems of quantum computation exist, defect based qubits offer a distinct advantage in their ability to operate optically and under room temperature conditions \cite{koehl2011room,weber2010quantum,falk2013polytype}. Furthermore defects in two-dimensional (2D) materials yield a higher-ceiling for defect based quantum technologies where spatially controlling doping, entangling qubits, and qubit tuning are all more attainable \cite{aharonovich2017quantum,sajid2020single}. In particular, two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride ($h$-BN) has demonstrated that it can host defect-based single photon emitters (SPEs) \cite{grosso2017tunable} and qubits \cite{gottscholl2020initialization}.

As such, my work has focused on the prediction of defects in $h$-BN for quantum applications. From a computational perspective, studying defects in 2D materials offers several technical challenges. In 2018, I was awarded an NSF scholarship for studying quantum information science through a program known as QISE-NET. This program provides supplemental funding to perform ongoing research in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory, so that we may study defects in $h$-BN (this was later highlighted in the UC Santa Cruz newsletter). In particular, these efforts culminated in our work from 2018, wherein we demonstrated how to compute the single-particle band gap of $h$-BN via a Koopmans' compliant hybrid functional approach which incorporates improved screening effects in our calculation but mitigates the expense of many-body theory based methods i.e. the GW approximation \cite{smart2018fundamental}. Additionally, this work demonstrated the layer dependence on defect ionization energies. Following this up, we then studied radiative and nonradiatiave recombination of defects in $h$-BN. One particularly interesting facet of this research in the demonstration of how significantly the nonradiative recombination of defects can be effected by strain, wherein we predicted the strain fingerprints of N$_\text{B}$V$_\text{N}$ which matches closely with subsequent experimental measurements.~\cite{mendelson2020strain}
Recently, I also implmented computing the zero-field splitting of $S \ge 1$ systems, an essential quantity in defect based-qubit systems like NV center in diamond. In addition, I have implemented computing intersystem crossing (necessary for spin initialization and readout) with spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interaction. With these computed static and dynamical properties,  we are able to predict spin qubits read-out efficiency and new quantum spin defect systems in hexagonal boron nitride which can be potential candidates for spin-based quantum technologies.
